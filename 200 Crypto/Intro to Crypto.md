Modulus is not reversible, has infinite possibilities

## Digital Signatures
Digital signatures are a way to prove the authenticity of files, to prove who created or modified them. Using asymmetric cryptography, you produce a signature with your private key and it can be verified using your public key. As only you should have access to your private key, this proves you signed the file.

## SSH private keeys
When generating an SSH key to log in to a remote machine, you should generate the keys on your machine and then copy the public key over as this means the private key never exists on the target machine. For temporary keys generated for access to CTF boxes, this doesn't matter as much.
### Using SSH keys to get a better shell
SSH keys are an excellent way to “upgrade” a reverse shell, assuming the user has login enabled (www-data normally does not, but regular users and root will). Leaving an SSH key in authorized_keys on a box can be a useful backdoor, and you don't need to deal with any of the issues of unstabilised reverse shells like Control-C or lack of tab completion.

# Hash
Hashes are a long strings of letters and numbers generated by hashing algorithms. They take plain text and make it a hash.

The important thing about hashes is that **they are not reversible**. There's no way to decrypt/decode a hash.

Popular hashing algorithms are : MD5 (Message Digest 5) and SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm).

That's how the word "hello" looks as MD5 hash : **5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592**

**What are hashes used for?**

The most popular use of hashes is for file identification and storing sensitive data, like passwords. When you create an account on a website your password is converted to hash and this hash is stored in the server's database. So when you login the password that you type in will be converted to a hash, the server will take it and compare it with the hash in it's database, if it's the same that means your password is correct and the server will let you in.

MD5 hashes are also used to ensure the data integrity of files. Because the MD5 hashing algorithm always produces the same output for the same given input, it can be used to compare a hash of the source file with a newly created hash of the destination file to check that it is intact and unmodified.
