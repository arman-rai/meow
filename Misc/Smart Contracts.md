Â A blockchain is a digital database or ledger distributed among nodes of a peer-to-peer network.

A majority of practical applications of blockchain rely on a technology known as a smart contract. Smart contracts are most commonly used as the backbone of DeFi applications (Decentralized Finance applications) to support a cryptocurrency on a blockchain. DeFi applications facilitate currency exchange between entities; a smart contract defines the details of the exchange. A smart contract is a program stored on a blockchain that runs when pre-determined conditions are met.
