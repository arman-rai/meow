# So what are computer networks?
	interconnection of various computers to share software, hardware, resources and data through communication medium between them
	They communicate using some protocols ex: https, smb etc

## Some business applications of computer networks in business are:
	1. Resouece sharing
	2. Server-Client databases
	3. Communication etc.


## Topologies of network
	1. Bus:
		Single direction communication flow, both  ends have a line terminator which removes the data from the line, uses CSMA/CD? tech and recognized one as a bus master.
	2. Star:
		Single point of failure, may have a L1(hub, repeater) or L2(Switch, Bridge) or L3(Router, Gateway) device as the central comms device
	3. Ring:
		Multiple points of failure, has two adjacent nodes which help transfer the data to the required node
	4. Mesh: 
		 Maybe full or partial mesh, full mesh has n(n-1)/2 connections and partial one has only some connected to n(n-1)/2 connections
	5. Tree:
		Has many layers such as core, distro, access which give out the hierarchy of the nodes, Single point of failure but more controlled  than star
	6. Hybrid:
		Combines all the advantages & disadvantages of all the above and more
	7. Cellular: 
		Wireless tech, has a central hub, don't know much about this


## Network types on basis of area
	1. PAN or HAN (personal, home)
	2. LAN (local)
	3. CAN (campus)
	4. MAN (Metropolitian)
	5. WAN (wide)
	6. SAN (storge)
	7. EPN (enterprise)
	8. VPN (virtual)

# Architectures of Networking
	1. Client-Server
	2. Peer-to-peer

### open standards and protocols 

# Models of networking
