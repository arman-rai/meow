# Theory of computation 

## includes the autmomated systems that perform mathematical computations

## Automata theory
	It can be used for verifying systems of all types that have finite number of distinct states, such as comms protocols, exchange algorithms
	It's a useful concept of software for natural language

## Definitions
	## Alphabets(sigma)
		Mathematically, It is a finite, non-empty set if symbols thath maket up the language og concern
	## String(word)
		A finite sequence of symbols taken from an alphabet
	## length(|w|)
		length of string
	## Empty string(epsilon)
		String consisting of zero occourences of symbils from an alphabe
	## Power of alphabet
		example:	
		sigma = {0.1}
		sigma^0 = {phi} // phi = empty_string
		sigma^1 = {0, 1}
		sigma^2 = {00, 01, 10, 11}
		i.e. sigma^k = {w| | w| k }

	# Kleene Closure(sigma^*)
		Set  of all the strings over an alphabet
		sigma^* = sigma^0 union sigma^1 union sigma^n
