/**
Program to simulate Simple Reflex Agent for detecting source of water leakage in a
house. (Recommended language: Python or C )
Note: Consider the followings while writing the code
We need to write code for an agent to detect water leakage in a house
The necessary input will be provided by corresponding sensors but for our
convenience we will take such values from user through console.

The rules to be considered are listed below:
 If hall is wet and kitchen is dry then there is leak in bathroom
 If hall is wet and bathroom is dry then there is problem in kitchen
 If window is closed or it is not raining then it is confirmed that
water is not from outside.
 If no water from outside and problem is in kitchen then leak is in
kitchen.
