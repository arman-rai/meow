For this box, in brief:

scan ports and find subdirs

found ssh port open

wget and git was present

transferred the scripts to the ssh’d user `jan` and then wget’ed the script

then run the script to find basic things like passwd for john `armando`

also we found out the user `kay` using the enum scrip

and also the private key for `kay`

then we had to crack the hash after id’ing the hash

we used hashcat for getting the hash

and then webgets us got the hash which was a md5 sum?? birse maile

us tthen we cracked the hash using johnny dai which gets us the required hash `beeswax`

then using the private key that we found on `jay's` ssh login

we then logged in to `kay@htbserver` using the file and we entered the passwd and we listed the files

we saw a `pas.bak` file that was a backup file which contained a passwd looking ascii

which was infact the passwd

yay
